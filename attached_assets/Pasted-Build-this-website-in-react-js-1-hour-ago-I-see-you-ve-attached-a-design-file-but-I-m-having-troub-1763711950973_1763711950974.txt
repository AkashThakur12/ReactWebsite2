Build this website in react js

1 hour ago
I see you've attached a design file, but I'm having trouble accessing the image. Let me help you build a website in React.js once I can see the design.

Could you try one of the following:

Re-upload the image - Sometimes files don't attach properly on the first try
Describe the design - Tell me what the website should look like (layout, sections, colors, content, purpose)
Share a link - If the design is hosted somewhere online, you can share the URL
Once I can see or understand the design, I'll create a detailed plan to build the website using React.js with a modern tech stack including Tailwind CSS for styling.

I'll fetch the Figma design to see what we're building.


Visited https://www.figma.com/design/4phie3kgGhXLqteXYpoj0A/Rudra-Raipur?node-id=2-2
I wasn't able to access the actual design content from Figma directly. Figma files require authentication and don't expose their design content publicly through direct URL fetching.

Could you help me understand what you need to build by providing:

Screenshots of the Figma design (you can export frames as images)
Description of the website:
What is "Rudra Raipur"? (business, portfolio, event, etc.)
What sections/pages does it need? (hero, about, services, contact, etc.)
Key features or functionality needed
Color scheme and design style (modern, minimal, bold, etc.)
Any specific content or interactions
Alternatively, if you can share view-only access or export the designs as images, I can create a precise implementation plan based on the actual design.

I understand you'd like me to build the website from that Figma design, but I'm unable to directly access the design content from Figma links due to authentication requirements.

To help you build this website in React.js, I can proceed in one of these ways:

Option 1: Describe the design to me
Tell me about the "Rudra Raipur" website:

What type of website is it? (business, portfolio, event, restaurant, etc.)
What sections does it have? (header, hero section, about, services, gallery, contact, etc.)
What's the general layout and style?
Any specific features or interactions?
Option 2: Share screenshots
Export key frames from Figma as images and share them here

Option 3: I can make reasonable assumptions
Based on the name "Rudra Raipur," I could build a professional business/corporate website with common sections and you can tell me what to adjust.

Which approach would you prefer? Or if you can provide any details about what the design contains, I'll create a comprehensive React.js implementation plan for you.
